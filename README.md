# ArduCAM_better
It's the project to make a readable and hackable code for Arducam

For now, it only support OV2640_mini & OV7670

I think erveryone would agree the original Arducam code is NOT very trackable, 
especially the GOD class with lot's of product and tremendous ifdef. 

So here is the cleaner version of Arducam code for arduino, with no desktop app/shield support.
It works on Arduino solely.
The functionality is only enough to get image for now, and it fulfill my project purpose, 
if anyone wants to add stuff/camera support, you're wellcome to fork and improve it.
